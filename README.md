# ChunkSpawnerLimit
Limit mob spawners per chunk

by default it will leave existing placed spawners alone, if you enable it in the config chunk loads will be checked and drop the spawners as items

commands are:
- /spawnerlist = list currently loaded spawners that are over the limit
- /spawnerdelete = drop currently loaded spawners that are over the limit as items at their location
